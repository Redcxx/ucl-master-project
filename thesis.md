### Tobias Suggestion

- start now



- most useful: pros and cons
- research side: newest papers, directions, SOTA
- abilities to make edits



- describe data
- describe tasks
- overleaf latex



- for employer
  - simple story
  - hand drawn cartoon
  - try to get things into same logic
    - make pre-trained, show same logic
    - temporal fine tuning, show it is better
    - cleanup -> find dirty sketches to clean up
    - produce rough sketches
      - three steps -> fit everything into same logic



- setup stuff in latex, nice layout title name
- write some chapters about what i am trying to do without saying what did I do
  - explain settings, 
  - ch 1 and 2

- another section for result
  - input output, how to quantify, table, numbers
  - outcomes, measurement of success
- architectures are for later

## Outlines

- colorization
  - anime sketch colorization is a difficult problem because neither depth or semantic information is presented in the sketches, there are infinite number of ways to produce feasible result, and there often lack of authentic pair of training data.
